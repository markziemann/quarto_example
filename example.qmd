## Some background about Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

Notice how the YAML header only contains the document title. 
The other formatting specifications are given in the `_quarto.yml` file. 
The benefit of doing it this way is that each qmd notebook in your will be generated with the same formatting in a consistent manner.
You can even specify the order in which the qmd files are rendered.
This means that a single `quarto render` command is enough to render your entire website,
analysis or thesis.

I have specified the code to be hidden which emphasises with results and discussion, but keeps the technical details for those who want them.
I am a fan of dark themes, but you can choose from a wide variety of styles.

Quarto has provided a lot of advances regarding references.
I have saved my library of articles in bibtex format and called this `references.bib` which will be incorporated into this document references section.
The `.bib` file was prepared for me using the [BibGuru website](https://app.bibguru.com/).

The citation style is defined with the `csl:` option.
You can see that I have selected the Harvard-Deakin style.
To get this working I had to download the CSL file for that style from the [CSL GitHub repo](https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles).
There are \>2000 styles to choose from.
This makes it very easy to swap styles, which is handy because we sometimes need to reformat our papers for a different journal.

You will also see that there is a a navigation bar across the top of the site,
this is a great way to link to related resources, including other pages of the website and
external resources like GitHub address.

Here is are some citations - for example reproducibility is important for trust in computational research [@Peng2011-tp].

## Example data analysis

In this report, we can also conduct some data analysis and visualisation. 

### Static chart

Here I will make a boxplot of flipper length in the penguin dataset.
Notice that I have included a specific caption for the chart below (Figure 1).

```{r}
#| label: boxplot1
#| fig-cap: Figure 1. Penguin boxplot.
#| warning: false
#| echo: false
adelie <- subset(penguins,species=="Adelie")
gentoo <- subset(penguins,species=="Gentoo")
chinstrap <- subset(penguins,species=="Chinstrap")
flipper_len <- list("adelie"=adelie$flipper_length_mm,
                    "gentoo"=gentoo$flipper_length_mm,
                    "chinstrap"=chinstrap$flipper_length_mm)
boxplot(flipper_len)
```

### Interactive chart

Using the power of plotly, this ggplot2 chart is easily made interactive.
Hover over the points to make use of it.

```{r}
#| label: plot1
#| fig-cap: Figure 2. Interactive chart of iris data.
#| warning: false
#| echo: false

p <- ggplot(data=iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width)) +
      geom_point(aes(color=Species, shape=Species)) +
      labs(title = "Iris sepal width vs length")

ggplotly(p)

```

### Statistical analysis

Here I will run a t-test to determine whether the difference between Adelie and Gentoo flipper length is statistically significant (Figure 2).

```{r}
#| label: ttest1
t.test(adelie$flipper_length_mm,gentoo$flipper_length_mm)
```

### Tabular data

Here I will give an example of a a table, generated with KableExtra (Table 1).

```{r}
#| label: table1
head(mtcars,10) %>% kbl(caption = "Table 1. Mtcars dataset") %>% kable_styling(full_width = FALSE)

```

### Flow chart

Here is an example of a flow chart using the DiagrammeR package.

```{r}
#| label: flowchart1
#| fig-cap: Figure 3. Project flowchart.

grViz("digraph flowchart {
      node [fontname = Helvetica, shape = rectangle]        
      tab1 [label = '@@1']
      tab2 [label = '@@2']
      tab3 [label = '@@3']
      tab1 -> tab2 -> tab3;
      tab3 -> tab1 }
      [1]: 'Data 1'
      [2]: 'Data 2'
      [3]: 'Results'
")

```

### Static images

Here is an example of adding an image to your report.
It can be located in your local git repo or somewhere else on the web.

## Conclusion

So as you can see, Quarto is great for publishing all sorts of content.

Here I'll cite the remaining two documents in the bib file. When conducted incorrectly, enrichment analysis is highly biased [@Timmons2015-jc].

One reason that poor methodology is so common in published works is that the statistical analysis appears more significant when incorrect methods are used [@Wijesooriya2022-xa].
It will take increased awareness for these problems to be eliminated from the literature.

## Session information

It is always a good idea to record information about the environment, which will help reproducibility.
You will see that I have hidden the session information details to keep the report uncluttered, but you can reveal them by clicking below.
