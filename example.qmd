## Some background about Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

Notice how the YAML header only contains the document title. 
The other formatting specifications are given in the `_quarto.yml` file. 
The benefit of doing it this way is that each qmd notebook in your will be generated with the same formatting in a consistent manner.
You can even specify the order in which the qmd files are rendered.
This means that a single `quarto render` command is enough to render your entire website,
analysis or thesis.

I have specified the code to be hidden which emphasises with results and discussion, but keeps the technical details for those who want them.
I am a fan of dark themes, but you can choose from a wide variety of styles.

Quarto has provided a lot of advances regarding references.
I have saved my library of articles in bibtex format and called this `references.bib` which will be incorporated into this document references section.
The `.bib` file was prepared for me using the [BibGuru website](https://app.bibguru.com/).

The citation style is defined with the `csl:` option.
You can see that I have selected the Harvard-Deakin style.
To get this working I had to download the CSL file for that style from the [CSL GitHub repo](https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles).
There are \>2000 styles to choose from.
This makes it very easy to swap styles, which is handy because we sometimes need to reformat our papers for a different journal.

You will also see that there is a a navigation bar across the top of the site,
this is a great way to link to related resources, including other pages of the website and
external resources like GitHub address.

Here is are some citations - for example reproducibility is important for trust in computational research [@Peng2011-tp].

## Example data analysis

In this report, we can also conduct some data analysis and visualisation. Notice that I have included a specific caption for the chart below (Figure 1).

```{r}
#| label: plot-penguins
#| fig-cap: Figure 1. Chart of penguin flipper and bill length.
#| warning: false
#| echo: false

ggplot(penguins, 
       aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = bill_length_mm)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = species, shape = species)) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("darkorange","purple","cyan4")) +
  labs(
    title = "Flipper and bill length",
    subtitle = "Dimensions for penguins at Palmer Station LTER",
    x = "Flipper length (mm)", y = "Bill length (mm)",
    color = "Penguin species", shape = "Penguin species"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

## My custom analysis

Here I will make a boxplot of flipper length.

```{r}
#| label: ttest
#| warning: false
#| echo: false
adelie <- subset(penguins,species=="Adelie")
gentoo <- subset(penguins,species=="Gentoo")
chinstrap <- subset(penguins,species=="Chinstrap")
flipper_len <- list("adelie"=adelie$flipper_length_mm,
                    "gentoo"=gentoo$flipper_length_mm,
                    "chinstrap"=chinstrap$flipper_length_mm)
boxplot(flipper_len)
```

Here I will run a t-test to determine whether the difference between Adelie and Gentoo flipper length is statistically significant.

```{r}
t.test(adelie$flipper_length_mm,gentoo$flipper_length_mm)
```

## Discussion

Here I'll cite the remaining two documents in the bib file. When conducted incorrectly, enrichment analysis is highly biased [@Timmons2015-jc].

One reason that poor methodology is so common in published works is that the statistical analysis appears more significant when incorrect methods are used [@Wijesooriya2022-xa].
It will take increased awareness for these problems to be eliminated from the literature.

## Session information

It is always a good idea to record information about the environment, which will help reproducibility.
You will see that I have hidden the session information details to keep the report uncluttered, but you can reveal them by clicking below.
